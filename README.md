# Glow-Ping-Pong
This is a simpler version of ping pong , where a both the rods move simultaneously.
Player may arrow keys or WSAD in 1 Player mode.
2 Player mode is currently in developmental phase, where I need to improve the key press events so as to enable both players use keys without any miss or glitch
